        <h1>FAQs</h1>
        <h2>Can I make a booking?</h2>
        <p>
          We are currently taking bookings for groups of 12 guests or more for a
          3 hour period, and in our indoor seating area only. The rest of the
          venue, including the beer garden, has ample space for walk-in guests.
          Please use the form <a href="contact.html">here</a> for further
          inquiries or to make a booking.
        </p>
        <h2>Can I book for less than 12 people?</h2>
        <p>
          As we transition back into our regular style of service, we are no
          longer taking bookings for groups smaller than 12, though we now have
          a capacity of 250 so there is usually plenty of space for walk-ins!
        </p>
        <h2>Can I book for longer than 3 hours?</h2>
        <p>
          Not at this stage, but you are welcome to move into a walk-ins area
          after your booking if there is space to do so. We kindly ask for no
          back-to-back bookings and only one booking per group only please! We
          also ask that guests leave the space promptly when their booking
          concludes to allow staff to thoroughly sanitise the area.
        </p>
        <h2>Can I book in the beer garden?</h2>
        <p>Currently the beer garden is only available for walk-in groups.</p>
        <h2>Have you adopted COVID safety measures?</h2>
        <p>
          To ensure the venue is as safe as possible for patrons and staff we
          are taking a number of measures including hand sanitizing stations,
          guest registration, table distancing, new cleaning procedures as well
          as digital ordering at table and payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tables will maintain a 1.5m distance from other tables to adhere to
          the 1 person per 2sqm restriction. Contactless ordering is available
          via QR code at the table and contact details of every patron must be
          taken for contact tracing. If you or any of your guests are sick
          please stay home and contact the venue to cancel your booking as soon
          as possible. If you have any additional questions, please contact us
          <a href="contact.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>How do I order and pay?</h2>
        <p>
          All ordering and payment can be done via your smartphone while at your
          table or at the bar. You can either order individually, if you’d like
          to pay separately, or together using the QR code that will be on your
          table. For more information on what happens when you arrive for a
          booking, contact us <a href="contact.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>What if I need to cancel my booking?</h2>
        <p>If you need to cancel for any reason please contact us <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>Are you hosting brewery tours?</h2>
        <p>Not currently, but we are working towards being able to host brewery tours again ASAP.</p>
        <h2>I lost something when I visited the Beer Hall. How can I inquire if it has been found?</h2>
        <p>People lose things in the Beer Hall all the time! Just fill in the form here and we’ll get back to you if we find it.</p>
        <h2>Can I bring my dog?</h2>
        <p>Yes! Friendly pups are more than welcome in the Beer Hall and we’d love it if you brought your furry mates along.</p>
        <h2>Are children welcome?</h2>
        <p> Yes! We even have a kids menu! Please keep in mind children and infants (even if they are in a pram) are required by the state government guidelines to be counted towards your booking. We ask all parents to supervise their children at all times and to ensure their child has shoes on at all times. We are unable to provide colouring pencils as we have in the past so please bring along entertainment from home for your child.</p>
